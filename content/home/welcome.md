The CARR (Community assets and relative rurality) index is a continuous, multidimensional
measure of rurality based on the concept of sustainable development that integrates measures
of environmental, social, and economic resources. The index incorporates traditional rurality
measures such as population density, distance from metropolitan areas, and developed
area with measures of availability and accessibility of 70 different infrastructure types that
support essential community services and community amenities. The index uses data last
updated in 2019 and was originally constructed for census block-groups in the coterminous
United States. The original dataset (K. S. Nelson and Nguyen 2022) can be found at Zenodo and
was described in an article in the Journal of Rural Studies (K. S. Nelson and Nguyen 2023).
