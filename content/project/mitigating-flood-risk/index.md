Paxico, Kansas is a rural small town with just over 200 residents. The majority of the town lies in a high flood risk zone, which has experienced limited economic development for over a generation. Local watershed districts and community leaders have consulted an engineering firm to reduce the risk of flooding, but proposed solutions are cost-prohibitive for this small community. SCALes PI Kate Nelson is part of a community science team composed of scientists, architects, and engineers familiar with federal flood risk programs and flood mitigation that have explored tangible steps that Paxico can take to reduce its flood risk. This project has been organized via the [American Geophysical Union's Thriving Earth Exchange](https://thrivingearthexchange.org/project/paxico-ks/) program.

A storymap documenting much of the project can be found [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e4cabd52b3f54511820e3d58b3cbe498).
