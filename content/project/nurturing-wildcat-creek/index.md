The ***Nurture Wildcat Creek*** initiative aims to promote community-engaged research and education in the Wildcat Creek Watershed in Riley County, Kansas.



Our goals are to:

1. Promote responsible and sustainable management of our local watershed resources. 
2. Develop tools and resources that empower citizens to make informed decisions about how they interact with their local environment. 
3. Improve public access to, and understanding of, Wildcat Creek and surrounding natural areas.
4. Produce evidence-based knowledge on the collective impacts of individual citizen actions to support the watershed and on the impacts of improved access to local natural resources on building a community of sustainability activism.



**Research**

Studies that support  sustainable management, use, and development of the watershed area by organizations and individuals. Basic science, applied science, or evaluation studies of all types are sought.



**Education**

Encouraging sustainable stewardship of our environment and fostering informal STEM learning by providing access to, and information about, Wildcat Creek.

Recent efforts include a panel series led by [Prairiewood](https://prairiewood.com/) in collaboration with K-State Libraries and the Department of Geography & Geospatial Sciences. Many thanks to Kelly Yarbourough, Carol Sevin, and Ellen Urton for their efforts to organize these events!
