In this project, led by Dr. Sam Zipper at the University of Kansas Geological Survey and conducted in collaboration with Dr. Erin Seybold (KGS) and Dr. Vaishali Sharda (KSU BioAg Engineering), we aim to identify ways to protect water resources while maintaining rural livelihoods in the face of a changing climate with strong impacts on agriculture.
