The BioWRAP project's primary aim is to reduce the use of plastics, herbicides and associated environmental impacts in agricultural production by creating an all-in-one bioplastic system that can better manage weeds, nutrients, soils, and water resources. Dr. Vaishali Sharda (KSU) is PI of the National Science Foundation (EPSCoR RII Track-2 FEC) funded project, that is being conducted in collaboration with researchers from Kansas State University, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. SCALes will contribute geospatial suitability analyses, spatial socioeconomic impact estimates, and associated rural resilience analyses to understand the transformative impact of technologies developed by the team.
