Critically examining how we define what is "rural" and the factors that are uniquely associated with sustainability in *rural* areas. Ongoing work includes:

* A systematic review of the drivers and outcomes of rural sustainability studies.
* Construction of alternative measures of rurality.
* Construction, sensitivity analysis, and validation of a measure of agricultural community adaptive capacity.
