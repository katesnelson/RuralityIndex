A variant of the original CARR index (2019 edition)  was calculated for county boundaries using area-weighted averages of the original CARR index at the block group scale. 

The county CARR data in .csv and STATA .dta format and the metadata for these files can be downloaded at [this link that is not live yet](thisfakelink.com). This data is also published and available for download at the long-term data repository [Zenodo](thisfakelink.com).

## Strategic Retreat

As natural disasters become more frequent and more severe there is significant discussion about whether it makes sense to rebuild developed areas following disasters. The idea of "strategic retreat" or "managed retreat" has seen increasing support as a flood adaptation and mitigation strategy. Across the globe, programs have been put into place to relocate individuals, and sometimes entire communities, that reside in flood-prone areas, reducing future flood damages, deaths, and injuries.  

Recognizing the importance of strategic retreat policies and programs in building a sustainable future we examine the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of voluntary buyout programs in the United States. Key findings include:

* Proactive implementation has the potential to greatly increase the economic efficiency of buyout programs (in terms of benefit:cost ratio).
* As buyout program size increases, and structures that experience less severe flooding are included, benefit:cost ratios begin to decline.
* The creation of greenspace associated with buyout programs can result in higher maintenance costs for municipalities, but these costs are offset by the flood-regulating ecosystem services the greenspace provides.
* In the U.S. Black populations have been increasingly less likely to receive FEMA-funded buyouts and are increasingly likely to receive disproportionately less money for their property when they do
  participate in buyouts.
