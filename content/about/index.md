title: About the Index
---

For nearly a century, researchers have been trying to define rurality in different ways for different
uses. Originally, rurality was used to define a space that is clearly delineated from urban-
industrial areas. For practical purposes, most measures of rurality define the rural-urban divide
based on population density and size, in part because population size and density information are
readily available and easy to apply. However, many have argued that, in post-industrial societies,
rurality must be multi-dimensional to include other measures such as environmental, social, and
economic resources. 

Rurality as a concept is more than just how physically isolated people are
from others. Our new measure, the **CARR index**, addresses these challenges by incorporating
measures of services and amenities along with traditional measures of rurality.
The CARR index offers several advantages over previous rurality measures. 

- First, it conceptually addresses basic life functions and well-being by evaluating the availability of modern services
and amenities. The index incorporates various community assets that meet fundamental needs.
- Second, by focusing on the semi-permanent assets of communities, the CARR index helps
policymakers and government agencies identify communities with resources that can be utilized
for growth and sustainability. 
- Third, researchers have noted that broad, aggregated spatial
analyses of service access can overlook significant variability within these areas. Therefore, finer
spatial scales are necessary to understand how services and amenities are distributed. In this
context, CARR’s higher spatial resolution captures within-community diversity, highlighting
issues like disparities in access to healthy food and healthcare. Because CARR is measured at the
block-group level, it is applicable to both urban and rural areas, such as counties or census tracts.
- Fourth, as a continuous measure, CARR is more sensitive to small changes compared to
categorical measures, allowing for more consistent tracking of rurality changes over time due to
shifts in population density or service availability.
- Fifth, CARR's continuous nature provides greater nuance and detailed analysis compared to most categorical measures. It can be used
flexibly in modern regression analyses, allowing it to be divided into deciles or interacted with
other variables to explore the relationships of rurality alongside other factors. Finally,
incorporating community assets into CARR alongside traditional rurality measures offers an
intuitive and consistent approach to evaluating rurality.


## Contact Info/Requests
We will continue to work on collecting various measures of community assets and relative
rurality and will update our CARR index over time. If you have any questions, please contact Kate
