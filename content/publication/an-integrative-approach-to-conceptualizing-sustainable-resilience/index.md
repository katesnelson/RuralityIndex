abstract: Vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability are three concepts
  commonly used in assessing the quality of a variety of systems. While each can
  be applied independently when performing risk analysis, there is growing
  interest across multiple disciplines in understanding how these concepts can
  be integrated when considering complex adaptive systems, such as communities.
  In this paper, we identify issues related to the use of these respective
  concepts in assessing complex adaptive systems, and describe how these issues
  may produce imbalanced results and maladaptive outcomes. We identify five
  critical areas where alignment and integration across concepts can lead to
  improved system assessment. As a result, we introduce a new paradigm,
  sustainable resilience, in which these concepts are integrated to enable
  alignment of adaptation and transformation strategies with desired resilience
  outcomes. This work provides the foundation for the development of an
  integrated assessment framework to help guide informed risk-based decision
  making for sustainable and resilient systems.
