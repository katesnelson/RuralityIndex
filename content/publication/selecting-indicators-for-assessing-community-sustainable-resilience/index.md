abstract: Communities are complex systems subject to a variety of hazards that
  can result in significant disruption to critical functions. Community
  resilience assessment is rapidly gaining popularity as a means to help
  communities better prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruption.
  Sustainable resilience, a recently developed concept, requires communities to
  assess system-wide capability to maintain desired performance levels while
  simultaneously evaluating impacts to resilience due to changes in hazards and
  vulnerability over extended periods of time. To enable assessment of community
  sustainable resilience, we review current literature, consolidate available
  indicators and metrics, and develop a classification scheme and organizational
  structure to aid in identification, selection, and application of indicators
  within a dynamic assessment framework. A nonduplicative set of community
  sustainable resilience indicators and metrics is provided that can be tailored
  to a community's needs, thereby enhancing the ability to operationalize the
  assessment process.
