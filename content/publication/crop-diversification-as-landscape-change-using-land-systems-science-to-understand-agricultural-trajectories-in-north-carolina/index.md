abstract: Diversifying crop systems represents a promising pathway to improved
  climate resilience in agriculture. After a century of radical crop system
  simplification, understanding processes of crop system diversification
  requires accounting for multiple interlinked factors and their contexts. This
  article suggests that the theoretical tools of land systems science offer a
  particularly useful approach for understanding processes of crop
  diversification at the meso-level. Results are presented from a mixed-methods
  project that used national datasets to identify agriculturally important
  counties in the United States whose cropping systems trended strongly towards
  either simplification or diversification between 2008 and 2020, then used
  in-depth interviews in two neighboring counties with opposite diversification
  trajectories to identify explanatory factors. Actors in both counties employed
  similar logic and values vis-à-vis markets, equipment, labor, and
  relationships, but were embedded within distinct ecological and political
  contexts that strongly influenced their diversification trajectories. We argue
  that crop diversification can be more productively understood as a meso-level
  process of land use change than a function of individual decision-making. Land
  systems approaches’ attention to social and biophysical dimensions, historical
  perspectives, and emphasis on embedding actors within socio-environmental
  contexts offer benefits for future work on processes of crop diversification.
