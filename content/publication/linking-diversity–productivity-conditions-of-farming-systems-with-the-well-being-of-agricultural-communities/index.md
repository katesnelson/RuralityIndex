abstract: Agricultural diversity, productivity, and human well-being have been
  popular topics in recent decades, partly fueled by our quest for
  sustainability. However, the exact nature of the interconnections among these
  global priorities remains an area yet to be fully understood and explored. We
  contribute to this literature by examining how community well-being interacts
  with distinct levels of diversity and productivity in cropping systems across
  multiple U.S. communities. Using data at the county-level from 2010 to 2019,
  we first analyze how well-being varies across communities that differ in their
  levels of crop diversity and productivity. Then, we investigate how well-being
  varies across both diversity–productivity characteristics and farming
  intensity levels. We employ mapping techniques in conjunction with descriptive
  statistics to uncover and visualize patterns in well-being across contexts.
  Study findings show a consistent pattern of high levels of well-being across
  most diversity–productivity categories, with the notable exception of areas
  that are both highly diverse and highly productive. In addition, places with
  substantial commercial operations, and where agriculture contributes greatly
  to overall GDP and employment generally appears to have higher well-being
  scores compared to other places. Our analysis also reveals that there is more
  variability in the index of community well-being within each group than across
  groups of counties. Overall, the results suggest that the differences in
  community well-being are not solely determined by agricultural indicators,
  such as diversity–productivity characteristics and farming intensity levels,
  but also depend on contextual factors, such as social infrastructure,
  non-agricultural job opportunities, or local economic diversification.
