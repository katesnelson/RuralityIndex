abstract: Transportation modeling within the context of extreme weather events
  induced by climate change is critical to understand and improve the resilience
  of transport systems as the world moves further into the 21st century. Among
  transportation modes, navigable inland waterways in particular face severe
  challenges to their future reliability as a result of extreme weather events.
  The economic implications of inland waterway operational efficiencies on
  commercial shipping have been studied in detail for several decades. Less well
  understood, however, are the effects of tow operation procedures enacted
  during adverse river conditions that have resulted from extreme weather
  events. This paper describes a model of a waterway segment that simulates
  stakeholder decision making and tow operator behavior to provide stakeholders
  with insights into the possible benefits of waterway action plans as
  operational guidance documents. Simulations run for a test area of the
  navigable inland waterway system indicated that operational procedures
  recommended in waterway action plans might have a significant impact on
  waterway operational efficiencies, which suggests that the model may be a
  useful decision-support tool for waterway stakeholders.
