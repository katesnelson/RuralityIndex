abstract: Voluntary home buyout programs have gained increasing popularity as a
  natural hazard mitigation tool over the past couple decades. However, a strong
  emphasis on the monetary value of disaster mitigation leaves open the
  possibility of inequity in distribution of the benefits of buyouts that may
  exacerbate social justice issues under conditions of increasing disaster
  damages due to climate change. Using a complete dataset of U.S. Federal
  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funded buyout properties we describe the
  demographic makeup of neighborhoods and counties that have participated in
  FEMA buyout programs since the 1980s and evaluate differential disadvantages
  in the chances of receiving a buyout and the amount of money received by
  buyout participants across characteristics associated with social
  vulnerability. We find that urban counties with greater resources are more
  likely to receive funds to administer a buyout program, and that within these
  counties, minority homeowners are less likely to receive federal aid dollars.
  In addition, we identify a trend of increasing disparity specifically for
  Black populations. Our findings suggest that intended objectivity in how
  voluntary buyout dollars are distributed has led to unintentional inequities
  at multiple scales that may become more pronounced without changes to existing
  policy and highlight the growing need for social equity consideration in
  strategic retreat planning.
