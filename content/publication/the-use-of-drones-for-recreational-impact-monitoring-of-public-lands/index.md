abstract: As visitation to park and protected areas increases globally, public
  land managers seek to increase the implementation of simple and cost-effective
  methods to collect indicator and threshold data to address environmental and
  visitor experience concerns. Unmanned aerial vehicles, also referred to as
  drones, may be a logical addition to monitoring regimes. This study examined
  the outcome of using overhead drone imagery to monitor two management-selected
  indicators, visitor created trails, and vegetation loss, in a newly
  established Kansas state park, Little Jerusalem Badlands. Images were analyzed
  by SamplePoint software in 10x10 meter grids with 100 sample points each.
  Within the first five months of the park opening, vegetation loss was observed
  in key areas of Little Jerusalem at rates varying from 2.7% to 42.3%. The
  formation of one visitor-created trail also occurred during this time. These
  results confirm the benefit of using drones for long-term monitoring of
  environmental indicators that will aid land management agencies in
  decision-making to reduce recreational impacts associated with visitor use.
