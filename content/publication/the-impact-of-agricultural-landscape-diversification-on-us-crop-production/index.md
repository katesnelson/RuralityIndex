abstract: The last century has seen a dramatic simplification of global
  landscapes, driven largely by the expansion and intensification of
  agriculture. Landscape simplification has known negative impacts on ecosystem
  health and function; however, less is known about how landscape simplification
  affects agricultural production. There is mounting field-scale evidence that
  simplification can reduce agricultural production by eroding the ecosystem
  processes on which agricultural systems depend; however, many of these
  processes emerge not at the field scale, but from complex interactions between
  land use, biophysical context, and human activity at the landscape scale. This
  research uses hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the relationship
  between landscape-scale agricultural diversity and the yields of corn, soy,
  and winter wheat in the coterminous United States. We find that the yields of
  corn and winter wheat increase by as much as 20% in highly diversified
  agricultural systems. Our findings also indicate that (1) crop production is
  more responsive to the number of distinct crop types cultivated on a landscape
  than their cultivated extent and that (2) increasing diversity in agricultural
  systems that are already diverse brings the highest yield gains. Our models
  provide strong evidence at national and regional scales that agricultural
  diversification—an intervention with known ecosystem benefits—can increase
  crop production.
