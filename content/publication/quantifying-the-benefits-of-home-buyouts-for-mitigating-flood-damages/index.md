abstract: With increasing costs of floods across the globe, interest has grown
  in using managed retreat strategies, such as home buyouts, for flood
  mitigation. For years, national-level estimates of the benefits of flood
  mitigation investments in the United States have been estimated as being on
  the order of 4:1 (USD) or more recently 6:1 (USD), according to the Federal
  Emergency management Agency and others. Localized evaluation of the true costs
  and benefits for communities is limited, however, and primarily centered
  around avoiding direct structural damages. Home buyouts, where individualsâ€™
  properties are purchased and removed from risk while reducing impervious
  areas, are only one of many mitigation options captured in the national
  estimates. This paper presents a scenario analysis to estimate a localized
  return on investment of a home buyout program for Nashville-Davidson County,
  Tennessee in the United States that justifies investment in such programs. It
  considers the cost of buyouts across the community over several decades. It
  also compares those costs to benefits such as changes in stormwater
  attenuation, damages avoided, and exposed populations for a specific extreme
  flood event. Overall, at a localized scale, the study demonstrates that the
  return on investment is comparable to national averages, and that proactive
  implementation significantly increases the value of benefits relative to
  costs. The approach has potential applicability to other areas in the United
  States and beyond. It can be used to make the case for investment in such
  mitigation programs utilizing similarly available data.
