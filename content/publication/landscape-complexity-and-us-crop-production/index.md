abstract: Agricultural expansion and intensification have simplified Earth’s
  landscapes, thereby adversely affecting the biodiversity and ecosystem
  services that support agricultural production. Field-scale research suggests
  that increased landcover complexity can improve crop productivity, but less is
  known about how complexity and crop productivity interact at broader landscape
  scales. This study evaluates the relationship between landscape complexity and
  crop yields for counties in the conterminous United States from 2008 to 2018.
  Our results suggest that the number and quantity of landcover categories on a
  landscape has a stronger influence on yields than how these landcover
  categories are arranged on the landscape. Specifically, increased landcover
  diversity is associated with yield increases for corn and wheat of more than
  10%—an effect strength similar to the impact of seasonal precipitation and
  soil suitability. Notably, landscape configurations that are both moderately
  complex and also highly diverse are associated with yield increases of more
  than 20% for corn and wheat. Our findings suggest that increasing the
  complexity of landcover may provide a way to improve crop productivity in the
  United States without further extensification or intensification of
  agriculture.
