abstract: Mulching practice offers farmers an opportunity to minimize the
  effects of drought, water loss, and soil erosion on crop production. Plastic
  film is widely used as a mulching material; however, contamination of arable
  lands by residual plastic has become a serious concern. Synthetic
  biodegradable mulch films and sprays may offer a more sustainable alternative
  to plastic films, however current evidence on the factors that influence the
  suitability of these products for agricultural applications is fragmented,
  making it unclear under what conditions these products meet agronomic,
  environmental, and societal needs. We address this gap by conducting a
  systematic review of studies that evaluate the use of synthesized
  biodegradable mulch for agricultural applications and extract data from 151
  primary studies on factors that directly and indirectly influence the
  suitability of its use. Like others, we find that using biodegradable mulches
  nearly always provides agronomic benefits over not mulching but rarely
  provides agronomic benefits over conventional plastic films. However, we also
  find that reported benefits vary across climate conditions, mulch type, and
  crop and agronomic factors tested, highlighting the context-specificity of
  biodegradable mulch benefits which is not yet well understood. In addition, we
  identify a need for studies that experimentally evaluate the secondary
  environmental and social benefits of biodegradable mulch use to provide a
  better understanding of the full potential of these products for sustainable
  agriculture.
