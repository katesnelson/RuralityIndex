abstract: Extreme weather and climate change can have a significant impact on
  all types of infrastructure and assets, regardless of location, with the
  potential for human casualties, physical damage to assets, disruption of
  operations, economic and community distress, and environmental degradation.
  This paper describes a methodology for using extreme weather and climate data
  to identify climate-related risks and to quantify the potential impact of
  extreme weather events on certain types of transportation infrastructure as
  part of a vulnerability screening assessment. This screening assessment can be
  especially useful when a large number of assets or large geographical areas
  are being studied, with the results enabling planners and asset managers to
  undertake a more detailed assessment of vulnerability on a more targeted
  number of assets or locations. The methodology combines climate, weather, and
  impact data to identify vulnerabilities to a range of weather and climate
  related risks over a multi-decadal planning period. The paper applies the
  methodology to perform an extreme weather and climate change vulnerability
  screening assessment on transportation infrastructure assets for the State of
  Tennessee. This paper represents the results of one of the first efforts at
  spatial vulnerability assessments of transportation infrastructure and
  provides important insights for any organization considering the impact of
  climate and weather events on transportation or other critical infrastructure
  systems.
