abstract: Ecological theory on diversity suggests that agriculture requires
  sufficient biodiversity, ecological function, and critical ecosystem services
  to remain sustainable and resilient. As such, research related to the effect
  of ecosystem services and diversity on crop yields has increased significantly
  in the past decade. One such study by Dainese and colleagues that presented a
  global synthesis of a compiled database of 1,475 crop experiments related to
  pollination and pest control ecosystem services and crop yields quickly
  garnered attention in the literature with more than 540 citations since its
  publication in 2019. Given the strong influence of this study on the research
  on diversity and agricultural production, we conduct a reanalysis on the
  publicly available dataset from the global synthesis study to test the
  robustness of findings to modeling approach and assumptions. In our reanalysis
  we apply ordinary least squares regression methods rather than Bayesian path
  analysis to the same data to examine the robustness of observed field-scale
  landscape diversity-ecosystem services-crop yield relationships. The result of
  our reanalysis supports the findings of Dainese and colleagues, illustrating
  the robustness of findings that suggest that increasing landscape simplicity
  is associated with lower rates of pollination and pest control ecosystem
  service provisioning and lower crop yields. However, our analyses also suggest
  that provisioning of pollination and pest control services account for only a
  small fraction of the total effect of landscape simplicity on crop yields.
  Furthermore, we find that management and soil health may mediate the effects
  of landscape simplicity on ecosystem services and crop yields. While our
  results complement previous findings for landscape simplicity and ecosystem
  services, they also indicate that above and below ground ecosystem services
  are not mutually exclusive but concurrently contribute to support crop
  production in agriculture.
