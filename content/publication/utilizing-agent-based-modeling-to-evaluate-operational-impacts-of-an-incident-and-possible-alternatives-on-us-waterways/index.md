abstract: Operations along inland waterways are particularly vulnerable to
  severe weather events which can create adverse conditions for towboat
  operators to manage, resulting in increased risk of accidents. However, it is
  challenging to know or understand the extent to which new regulations or
  policies on tow operating procedures may reduce impacts from a given scenario.
  An agent-based model (ABM) representing actual river operating procedures was
  developed previously to evaluate emergent characteristics and system-wide
  impacts arising from the interactions between disruptions, towboat operator
  responses, and regulations. In this work, we validate the effectiveness of the
  ABM model for improved decision support by comparing it with observed waterway
  traffic as captured by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, then apply
  the model to a case study based on a 2005 incident on the Ohio River. A series
  of counterfactual scenarios are simulated to better understand potential
  impacts of the incident on waterway system performance and potential
  alternative outcomes given different operational responses and regulations.
  The analysis indicates that imposing tow movement restrictions, such as
  waiting for a helper towboat, under adverse river conditions can result in a
  general slowing of the system but with potentially lesser impacts than what
  would be caused if the system operates as normal and results in an incident
  that lasts multiple days. The analysis also indicates that the waterway system
  can return to normal operations within a matter of weeks.
