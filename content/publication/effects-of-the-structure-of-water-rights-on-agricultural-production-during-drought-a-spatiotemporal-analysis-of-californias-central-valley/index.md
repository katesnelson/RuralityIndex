abstract: "California's Central Valley region has been called the “bread-basket”
  of the United States. The region is home to one of the most productive
  agricultural systems on the planet. Such high levels of agricultural
  productivity require large amounts of fresh water for irrigation. However, the
  long-term availability of water required to sustain high levels of
  agricultural production is being called into question following the latest
  drought in California. In this paper, we use Bayesian multilevel
  spatiotemporal modeling techniques to examine the influence of the structure
  of surface water rights in the Central Valley on agricultural production
  during the recent drought. California is an important place to study these
  dynamics as it is the only state to recognize the two dominant approaches to
  surface water management in the United States: riparian and appropriative
  rights. In this study, Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling is employed to account
  for spatial processes that have the potential to influence the effects of
  water right structures on agricultural production. Results suggest that, after
  accounting for spatiotemporal dependencies in the data, seniority in surface
  water access significantly improves crop health and productivity on cultivated
  lands but does not independently affect the ability to maintain cultivated
  extent. In addition, agricultural productivity in watersheds with more junior
  surface water rights shows less sensitivity to cumulative drought exposure
  than other watersheds, however the extent of cultivation in these same
  watersheds is relatively more sensitive to cumulative drought exposure."
