abstract: Prior research suggests that greater spatial diversity in crops and
  land use is associated with higher crop yields and improved ecosystem
  function. However, what leads to the emergence of agricultural systems that
  meet both productivity and ecological health goals remains an open question.
  Understanding the factors that differentiate these places from other
  agricultural systems is key to understanding the mechanisms, pathways,
  consequences, and constraints to employing diversification as a tool for
  increasing agricultural sustainability. In this study, we employ archetype
  analysis to examine the factors uniquely associated with the conjoint
  existence of high crop diversity and high crop productivity. We identify five
  agricultural system classes that represent a range of diversity and
  productivity combinations using k-means cluster analysis then use random
  forests analysis to identify factors that strongly explain the differences
  between the classes—describing different agricultural production regimes. Our
  exploratory analysis of the difference in agricultural system factors across
  classes suggests (1) crop diversity and its preconditions are associated with
  the highest yields, (2) biophysical conditions bound diversity-productivity
  realities, (3) productivity comes at a petrochemical cost, and that (4) crop
  rotations are a key diversification strategy. Overall, our results suggest
  that despite clear biophysical constraints on transitions to high
  diversity—high productivity systems the role of actionable factors on crop
  production regimes is stronger, providing reason to be hopeful about
  transitions to agricultural production regimes fit for new climate realities.
