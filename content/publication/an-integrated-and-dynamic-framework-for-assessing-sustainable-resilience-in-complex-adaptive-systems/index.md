abstract: Growing awareness of climate change and resulting impacts to
  communities have generated increasing interest in understanding relationships
  between vulnerability, resilience, sustainability, and adaptive capacity, and
  how these concepts can be combined to better assess the quality of complex
  adaptive systems over time. Previous work has described interactions between
  these concepts and the value-added should they be integrated and applied in a
  strategic manner, resulting in a new understanding of system quality defined
  as sustainable resilience. However, a framework for explicitly integrating
  vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability assessment to develop
  understanding of system sustainable resilience has yet to be proposed. This
  paper presents a high-level, integrated and dynamic framework for assessing
  sustainable resilience for complex adaptive systems. We provide a set of
  functional definitions, a description of each step in the proposed assessment
  process, and walk through an example application of the framework, including a
  discussion of preliminary analyses, technical methodologies employed, and
  suggested future advances.
