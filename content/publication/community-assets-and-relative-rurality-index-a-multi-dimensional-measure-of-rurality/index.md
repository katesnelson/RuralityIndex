abstract: Rurality is often viewed as presenting challenges to community
  sustainability, well-being, and equity. To address the unique challenges of
  rural areas, policies and practices have been designed specifically for
  application in places designated as “rural”. Yet what is “rural”? Some recent
  measures of rurality have gone beyond a dichotomous rural-urban divide
  conceptualization of rural communities. However, most measures still emphasize
  proximity to metropolitan areas and population density as the primary
  components of rurality. Few studies consider the critical role that services
  and amenities play in the life of a community. We suggest a new measure based
  on the concept of sustainable development that integrates measures of
  environmental, social, and economic resources. We present the Community Assets
  and Relative Rurality index for census block-groups in the coterminous United
  States and illustrate how this measure is consistent with existing measures of
  rurality yet offers additional insight into issues of sustainable rural
  development.
