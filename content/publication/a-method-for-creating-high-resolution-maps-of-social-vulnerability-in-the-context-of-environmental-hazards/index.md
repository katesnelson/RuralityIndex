abstract: The availability of demographic information from census data has
  enabled the development of indices that describe the relative social
  vulnerability of populations at different locations. These indices are often
  used in conjunction with models of physical exposure to environmental hazards,
  such as flooding and hazardous waste emission, to identify populations at
  greatest risk. However, using standard census areal units to calculate social
  vulnerability can lead to significant underestimation of vulnerable
  populations as environmental hazards typically occur on a finer spatial scale
  than census units such as block groups. This paper describes and illustrates a
  hybrid method for creating a social vulnerability index (SVI) at a tax parcel
  level by utilizing supplementary information about tax parcels to link
  cadastral dasymetric mapping techniques and established social vulnerability
  indexing methods. This high resolution social vulnerability index may be used
  for planning at the municipal level to address existing or potential
  environmental justice issues.
