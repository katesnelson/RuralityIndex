abstract: We examine the geographies of agricultural yields in the United
  States, home to some of the most productive agricultural systems on the
  planet. We model and map yield divergence from biophysical expectations and
  regional norms for five major crops—corn, soy, wheat, alfalfa, and hay—and
  assess how this divergence interacts with farm-level resources, farm(er)
  characteristics, and landscape context. Our results highlight the ways in
  which human activity has reinforced and intensified the yield geographies
  defined by sun, soil, and water alone. Yield gains brought by human activity
  are strongly associated with increased expenditure on inputs to production and
  receipts from federal programs, but not with net revenue gains for farmers.
  These yield gains vary across operator race, gender, farm size, and major US
  region. We also find that beyond a threshold, increased input expenditure is
  associated with marginally decreasing yields, raising important questions
  about the interactions between yields and farmer livelihoods. We conclude by
  discussing the importance of broadening the production-centric paradigm that
  has dominated agricultural innovation over the last century to include the
  well-being of the farmers and ecological systems on which agricultural
  production ultimately depends.
