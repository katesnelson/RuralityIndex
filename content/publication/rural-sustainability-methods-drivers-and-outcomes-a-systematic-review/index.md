abstract: In the past three decades, sustainability science has taken on new
  importance as interest groups investigate better ways to tackle global
  challenges—environmental degradation, climate change, and human
  well-being—that pose risks to communities, particularly in rural areas.
  Designs for sustainability require empirical evidence of what works and under
  what human and environmental conditions. Despite the amount of research that
  exists, the broad variety of research approaches and contexts makes
  generalizing knowledge about sustainability in rural areas challenging. This
  work addresses calls to consolidate the field's knowledge about rural
  sustainability by examining how rural sustainability has been evaluated,
  identifying drivers of rural sustainability and associated outcome indicators
  used to operationalize rural sustainability, and determining common trends in
  how drivers and outcomes are related. We synthesize this diverse literature to
  identify common themes in evaluation of rural sustainability across
  disciplines, global regions, and methodological approaches. Our findings
  indicate many methods have been used to evaluate rural sustainability, that
  factors derived from the Triple Bottom Line (social, economic, and
  environmental) are frequently used to operationalize rural sustainability, and
  that both direct human interventions and underlying socioeconomic drivers of
  sustainability are routinely examined in the literature. Overall, we find the
  majority of studies report positive impacts to rural sustainability,
  suggesting there are many avenues for creating positive change in
  sustainability in rural areas. However, we also find greater attention to
  study conceptualization, design and reporting is needed to provide greater
  confidence in results that inform policy and decision-making.
