abstract: Cropland expansion and agriculture intensification have been the
  primary methods to increase food production since the 19th century. The
  resulting landscape simplification, however, can impede long-term agricultural
  crop productivity. This paper examines the role of landscape diversification
  on resilience of corn, soy, and winter wheat production, in terms of crop
  yield and yield variability, in the state of Kansas. The study uses panel data
  analysis with county fixed effects and time trends to estimate the
  relationship between landscape diversity and crop production resilience.
  Results show that diversity has a significant positive effect on yields after
  controlling for weather, irrigation, and chemical inputs. We find that the
  yields of winter wheat increase, on average, by 28% at high levels of
  landscape diversity, while corn and soy yields increase 7% and 5%,
  respectively. In addition, we find that increases in landscape diversity are
  significantly associated with reduced yield variability for winter wheat and
  corn, and that landscape diversity mitigates the effect of extreme weather
  conditions on yield. Study findings suggest that within a single, relatively
  low diversity state, increasing landscape diversity is positively associated
  with crop production resilience. Future extreme climate conditions may reduce
  crop yields and yield stability, requiring appropriate policies to ensure food
  security. Our findings suggest that landscape diversification may be an
  important tool within a portfolio of approaches to increase crop resilience
  under highly variable weather conditions.
