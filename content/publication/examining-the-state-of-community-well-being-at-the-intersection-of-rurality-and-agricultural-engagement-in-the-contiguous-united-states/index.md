abstract: As the 21st century progresses, rural residents across the United
  States have often found themselves in disadvantaged positions by many
  socio-economic measures compared to their urban counterparts. In addition,
  agriculture– once the emblem of rurality– shares a disputed relationship with
  the well-being of rural communities in social science literature. However, the
  literature specifically related to how community well-being (CWB) varies
  across both rurality and agricultural engagement is limited. This study
  addresses this gap in the body of knowledge. Using county-level data on
  socioeconomic conditions from the past decade, we examine how agricultural
  engagement is associated with community well-being in rural areas. We combine
  descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis with mapping techniques
  to identify and visualize patterns in the data. We show that CWB varies widely
  regardless of rural status and engagement in agriculture across the 3107
  counties included in the study. However, the most disadvantaged communities
  are primarily located in rural places. Study findings also show that
  agricultural engagement is usually associated with somewhat improved, but not
  significantly different, CWB in rural areas. These findings indicate that the
  level of urbanicity/rurality might be the primary factor driving differences
  in CWB and that CWB in rural communities is generally similar regardless of
  local economies’ reliance on agriculture.
