abstract: Landscape complexity promotes ecosystem services and agricultural
  productivity, and often encompasses aspects of compositional or
  configurational land cover diversity across space. However, a key agricultural
  diversification practice, crop rotation, extends crop land cover complexity
  concurrently across space and time. Long-term experiments suggest that complex
  crop rotations can facilitate yield increases in major crops. Using a compiled
  county-annual panel dataset, we examined whether yield benefits of crop
  rotational complexity were apparent on a landscape scale in the conterminous
  US for four major crops between 2008 and 2020. We found that the benefit of
  rotational complexity was only apparent for cotton and winter wheat, and that
  the benefit for wheat was driven by one region. Corn exhibited the opposite
  pattern, wherein higher yields were consistently obtained with lower
  rotational complexity, while soybean yield appeared relatively insensitive to
  rotational complexity. Effects of rotational complexity were sometimes
  influenced by agrochemical usage. Positive effects of rotational complexity
  were only apparent with high fertilizer for soybean and wheat, and with low
  fertilizer for cotton. Corn yield in high-complexity, low-yielding counties
  appeared to improve with high fertilizer inputs. For the overwhelming majority
  of acres growing these major crops, crop rotation patterns were quite simple,
  which when combined with the short time span of available data, may explain
  the apparent discrepancy between long-term experiments and nationwide data.
  Current demand and incentives that promote highly intensified and specialized
  agriculture likely hinder realization of the benefits of rotational complexity
  for production of key crops in the US. Increasing rotational complexity where
  major crops are grown thus remains an underutilized approach to mitigate
  landscape simplification and to promote ecosystem services and crop yields.
