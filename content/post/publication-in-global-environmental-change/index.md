Our paper on equity of a strategic retreat program, [Differential disadvantages in the distribution of federal aid across three decades of voluntary buyouts in the United States](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021000571?via%3Dihub), has been published in Global Environmental Change! While minority populations are generally less likely to receive buyouts we find that specifically Black populations are increasingly disadvantaged, receiving fewer buyouts and at lower compensation levels over time.
