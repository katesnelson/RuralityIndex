Michael and Kate's reanalysis study was recently published in *PLOS One*! 

The study, "[Effects of landscape simplicity on crop yield: A reanalysis of a global database](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0289799)" reanalyzes an existing dataset of field-scale crop experiments with information on landscape diversity, ecosystem services, and yields. Using alternate modeling approaches we find evidence to support the findings of the original study that suggest that landscape simplification is associated with lower pollination and natural pest control services and lower crop yields. However, our results also suggest that other factors may be at play in the relationship between landscape simplicity and crop yields.
