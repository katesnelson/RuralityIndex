Michael was awarded a 2023 [Kale graduate fellowship](https://www.k-state.edu/geography/research/fellowships.html) to support his research on adoption of biodegradable mulch films in cropping systems. The Steve Kale Graduate Fellowship provides funds to support ambitious and high-caliber research conducted as part of a thesis or dissertation. The focus of the Kale Fellow should be entirely on these research activities while the fellowship is held. Each Kale Fellow will present a research colloquium to the Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences during the fall semester following the fellowship. The fellowship is named in honor of Steve Kale, a native Kansan and Geography alumnus, and his goal of supporting student research in geography.
