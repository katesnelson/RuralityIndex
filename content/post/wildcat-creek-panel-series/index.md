Wildcat Creek flows through the heart of Manhattan, but how much do you know about our local watershed? Prairiewood has teamed up with K-State Libraries and the geography and geospatial sciences department along with other partners to organize a series of free events in August all about Wildcat Creek. Save the dates for Aug. 15, 22 and 28, and join us for these great events:

Aug. 15: Join Denise Kidder with Friends of the Kaw at Walnut Pond to learn about insects and water health in Wildcat Creek. Great for kids and grandkids. Come prepared to step into some water. [More information is available on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/517660126188564).

Aug. 15: Bring a lawn chair and join us at Walnut Pond for the first in a series of three outdoor panel discussions exploring topics around Wildcat Creek watershed health.

Panelists include Samantha Estabrook, resiliency planner for the city of Manhattan; Laurie Harrison, Riley County Emergency Management; Aaron Apel, Gravel City Adventure and Supply Company and trail advocate; Denise Kidder, Friends of the Kaw; and Tim Keane, professor emeritus of landscape architecture and community & regional planning. [More information is available on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/314763337068592).
