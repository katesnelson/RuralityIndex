Our paper on our developed "rurality" index (CARR) was recently published in the *Journal of Rural Studies*!

The paper, "[](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac7e5f)[](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2471)[Community assets and relative rurality index: A multi-dimensional measure of rurality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016722003254)" describes a proposed metric for rurality studies that combines measures of access to more than 50 types of community assets and physical resources with traditional measures of population density and remoteness.
