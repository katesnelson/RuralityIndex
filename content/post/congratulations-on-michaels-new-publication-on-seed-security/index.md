Dï»¿enise will attend the [Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrated Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE) Summer School](https://iguide.illinois.edu/summer-school-2023/) in August 2023 on Convergence Science in Action. At the week-long workshop in Denver, CO about 35 graduate students and early career scholars will collaborate with project members of I-GUIDE to develop novel solutions to complex problems that rely on computation- or data-intensive geospatial data science. Congratulations on being selected to attend, Denise!
