A study conducted in collaboration with graduates of K-States Agricultural Economic PhD program will be published in *Environmental Research Letters*! 

The paper, "[Higher landscape diversity associated with improved crop production resilience in Kansas-USA](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac7e5f)" shows that diversification of agricultural landscapes in Kansas is generally associated with improved yields, greater yield stability, and higher resistance to the negative effects of poor weather conditions. These findings are most clear for winter wheat, then corn, with a limited influence observed on soy. This work provides further evidence in support of diversification of agricultural systems and illustrates that, while there may be both upsides and downsides to diversification, on the whole it has a positive impact on crop production resilience - even within the grain belt of the US.
