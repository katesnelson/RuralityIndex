A study conducted in collaboration with [Dr. Emily Burchfield](org) and [Dr. Michael Crossley](https://sites.udel.edu/agriculturalentomology/) was just published in *Environmental Research Letters*! 

The paper, "[Rotational complexity across US counties is currently insufficient to observe yield gains in major crops](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad300b/meta)" describes cropping patterns and rotational complexity computed for the coterminous U.S. between 2008 and 2020. We further examine the relationship between county average rotational complexity and crop yields over this same time period, finding only small positive associations between increased rotation complexity and yield for wheat and soy. Overall, our findings suggest that the vast majority of U.S. croplands have very low rotational complexity which is unlikely to support significantly higher yields within a decadal time frame.
